This is a module 3 project that will use "Terminal" and "Visual Studio" applications.

## Overview of Election Audit

Tom, a Colorado Board of Elections employee, requested help in completing the audit of a recent local congressional election.
  
Below are the results of the data analysis that was provided to Seth and his Team with the findings of the following tasks in the first draft of the election audit:

The findings of the following tasks were added to the final election audit:

1. Calculate the voter turnout for each county.
2. Calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
3. Determine the county with the highest turnout.

## Election-Audit Summary

Recommendations:

1. The data analysis tool "Python scripts" that was created for this specific tasks can be used for future congressional election as long as the election results template remain the same. The code can be further modified to perform data analytics on:
- Senatorial distric elections,
- Local elections, and
- Analyze for voters fraud.

2. Hire a data programmer to further optimize the program by Code Refactoring to further clarify and simplify the design of existing codes and accomodate new data that will be pertinent for the outcome of any type of election.
